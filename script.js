// TODO1 -  make numbers appear in input section/ style it
// TODO2 -  

// remaining todos...
// We will need functions for all the computation types (+, -, x, /)

// They should probably take in 2 operands and then perform calculation
// ie function add (operand1,operand2=operand1) 
// *made operand 2 equate to operand 1 by default 
// because that's what the apple calculator does

// we will likely need to make the operand 1 and operand 2 global variables to keep state

// after each operator is is pressed store the result as the global operand in order to keep "state"
